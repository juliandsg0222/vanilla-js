// What will be the result of this code?

let x = 1; // jshint ignore:line

function func() {
  window.console.log(x); // ?

  let x = 2; // jshint ignore:line
}

func();
// P.S. Thereâ€™s a pitfall in this task. The solution is not obvious.

// It'll show an error because declaring the function
// it doesn't have access to the external scope.
// And in its own scope the variable first is called
// before to be declared
